A core mod that Grimoire-Mixins Modules use to be loaded up.

#### What is it?

Grimoire is a coremod that implements [Sponge Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) and allows to 'organize' the order of mixins modules that will me implemented.
These module are internally called 'Grim-Patchs'

###### What is Sponge Mixin?

Basically it's a program that allows editing other programs at run time.

For example, if there is a mod that causes tons o lag and the author does not give you the source code for you to edit it and recompile, you can use Sponge Mixin to edit that mod at runtime and fix the problem by yourself.

### Where are the Grimoire Modules/Patches ?

You can find them over here: [Grimoire-Mixins](https://github.com/CrucibleMC/Grimoire-Mixins)
